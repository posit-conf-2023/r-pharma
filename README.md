## Overview

In this workshop we will introduce the pharmaverse, a collection of open source R packages that provide the next generation backbone for clinical trial reporting. As of March 2023, 123 people from more than 10 companies have contributed to the pharmaverse packages - and this workshop is about how you can both leverage their work to date and get involved to help evolve this important collection of efforts.

We will create ADaM datasets, prepare tables and figures as well as interactive shiny apps. This course will also give a grounding in how to navigate pharmaverse R packages, and their repositories, and understand how you can contribute.

You should take this workshop if you are interested in the future of clinical trial reporting, and would like to join this shift to between company collaboration.
